# Testing guide — the owner's regression checklist

A scripted playtest per major feature: exact clicks/keys, what you should see, and what
"broken" looks like. Run through these after any change that touches the map, the ship
simulation, or the deck views.

**Before you start:** run `./run.ps1` (Release build) and open the printed localhost URL.
Debug WASM runs on the IL interpreter and is roughly **100× slower** — choppy frames, sluggish
plotting, and timings in these scripts (rum wobble, boarding time, warp behavior) will all read
wrong under Debug. If a script feels broken, check you're not accidentally running
`./run-debug.ps1` first.

Each script links to the matching [feature doc](features/) if you need the full behavior
reference.

## 1. Launch + scenario select

*(See [scenarios.md](features/scenarios.md).)*

1. Open the home page (`/`).
2. Click **Launch** on the **Sol** card.
3. Confirm the map loads with the scenario name "Sol" in the HUD, no `EU ⚡` badge.
4. Go back, click **Launch** on **Sol (Electric)**.
5. Confirm the `EU ⚡` badge appears next to the scenario name.
6. Manually edit the URL to `/map?scenario=wheel` and reload.
7. Confirm "Wheel" loads (Venus/Earth/Mars visibly on a rigid spoke around Saturn once zoomed
   out).
8. Try `/map?scenario=not-a-real-scenario` — confirm it silently falls back to Sol, no crash.

**Broken looks like:** blank canvas, a spinner that never clears past "Rigging the sails…", or
the wrong scenario's bodies rendering.

---

## 2. Warp / pause / follow

*(See [map-and-warp.md](features/map-and-warp.md).)*

1. Launch Sol. Drag the warp slider to roughly the middle.
2. Confirm the readout shows an increasing multiplier (e.g. `100×`) and sim time is advancing.
3. Click **Pause**. Confirm the readout shows `∥` and sim time freezes.
4. Click **Pause** again to resume.
5. Drag the warp slider to maximum. Confirm the effective-warp readout shows `(auto-drop from
   N×)` once a planet or encounter gets close, and the multiplier actually shown is lower than
   the slider's request.
6. Drag the map to pan away from the ship, then click **Follow Ship**.
7. Confirm the camera snaps back to the ship and stays centered as time advances.

**Broken looks like:** sim time not advancing at all, warp stuck at 1×, or Follow Ship not
re-centering.

---

## 3. Hand-flying pulses

*(See [map-and-warp.md](features/map-and-warp.md).)*

1. Launch Sol, note the ship speed readout and the "circular here" value beside it.
2. Press `↑` (or `+`). Confirm speed increases ~10% and "Mass pulses" ticks down by 1.
3. Immediately press `↑` again. Confirm you see "Pulse drive cooling down…" (cooldown is ~1
   second — a second press just after the first should be rejected).
4. Wait a beat, press `Shift`+`↑`. Confirm speed increases only ~1% (fine trim).
5. Press `↓` repeatedly (with pauses) until mass pulses hit 0, away from any port zone.
6. Confirm an **Adrift** red alert bar appears with "Request rescue".

**Broken looks like:** pulses not decrementing, speed not changing, or no cooldown message on a
double-press.

---

## 4. Plotting a course + closest-pass warning

*(See [plotting-desk.md](features/plotting-desk.md).)*

1. Launch Sol. Click **Plot** (or press `P`). Confirm sim time freezes and the plot card appears.
2. Drag the scrub slider forward a few days. Confirm every planet shows a faint ghost tethered to
   its live position.
3. Click **Add burn at scrub**. Confirm a node appears in the list at that scrub time.
4. Set it to **Decelerate**, pulses = 3, percent = 10.
5. Confirm the ribbon visibly bends and a "Closest pass" line appears under the horizon controls.
6. Drag the scrub slider so the ribbon's path visibly crosses through a planet. Wait ~1 second.
7. Confirm the closest-pass line turns **red** and reads "IMPACT, captain!".
8. Adjust the node's percent down until the pass clears the planet by a few radii — confirm the
   line turns **yellow** under 5 R, and gray/neutral once well clear.
9. Click **Play** (or `P`) to resume live flight.

**Broken looks like:** no ribbon at all, closest-pass never updating, or the color thresholds not
matching (never turning red on an obvious intersection).

---

## 5. Traffic board + intercept

*(See [traffic-board.md](features/traffic-board.md).)*

1. Launch Sol. Click **Traffic**. Confirm a table of callsigns/cargo/routes appears.
2. Click a row for a Luna pod (`Callsign` containing a short Earth→Mars or Earth→Venus route,
   `Status` = En route or Tracked). Confirm the row highlights.
3. Confirm a **Pin** button appears in the card footer reading "Pin: brakes at *destination*".
4. Click **Pin**. Confirm a prediction cone is drawn on the map from the target outward.
5. Open **Plot**, add a burn that bends your ribbon into the cone.
6. Return to Play, warp forward, and confirm the target's row status flips through `En route` →
   `Tracked` (and to `Lost` if you stop observing it for over 2 sim-hours).

**Broken looks like:** empty table, no cone drawn after Pin, or status never changing.

---

## 6. Scope

*(See [scope.md](features/scope.md).)*

1. Launch Sol. Click **Scope**. Confirm a target renders with lock brackets, distance, and
   relative speed.
2. Confirm the corner label reads **◆ AUTO**.
3. Click **▶** a few times. Confirm the target changes each click and the label switches to
   **◆ TRACK**.
4. Click the middle **AUTO** button. Confirm it returns to auto-lock and the label flips back.
5. With nothing observed nearby, confirm it still shows a celestial body rather than "NO TARGET"
   static (static should only appear with zero candidates at all).

**Broken looks like:** scope panel blank, cycling not changing the target, or the label never
switching between AUTO/TRACK.

---

## 7. Orbit assist + armed insertion

*(See [orbit-assist.md](features/orbit-assist.md) and [plotting-desk.md](features/plotting-desk.md).)*

1. Launch Sol. Fly (or warp) toward Earth until an orbit strip appears in the HUD reading
   "🛰 Orbit Earth — …".
2. Confirm the two progress bars (distance-vs-Hill, speed-vs-limit) move as you approach.
3. Once it reads "window OPEN" and the button is green, press `O`.
4. Confirm mass pulses drop by the shown cost and the ship's relative velocity to Earth goes
   to ~0.
5. Undo by pulsing away, then open **Plot**, scrub to a pass near Mars, and confirm an "Insert at
   Mars pass…" button appears if the pass is close enough.
6. Click it to arm — confirm it turns green and reads "Insertion ARMED — will orbit Mars…".
7. Return to Play and let time run past the window opening.
8. Confirm the game auto-fires the burn, deducts pulses, shows "Planned insertion executed —
   bound to Mars 🛰", and the armed button clears.

**Broken looks like:** the button never enabling despite being inside the Hill sphere and slow
enough, or an armed insertion never firing once the window opens.

---

## 8. Depot plunder

*(See [depots.md](features/depots.md) and [boarding-run.md](features/boarding-run.md).)*

1. Launch Sol. Open **Traffic** and find a row named "*Planet* Depot" (e.g. "Mars Depot").
2. Select it, Pin it, and orbit-assist into the same planet (step 7 above).
3. Confirm your relative speed to the depot is near zero once you're both in the same orbit.
4. Wait for the boarding progress bar to appear and fill; confirm it completes close to the
   ~30-second best case (since relative speed/distance should both be tiny).
5. Dock and confirm the depot's cargo (matching the planet's flavor, e.g. Ice at Mars) is in your
   hold.

**Broken looks like:** the depot never appearing on the board, or boarding taking as long as a
sloppy high-speed intercept despite near-zero relative speed.

---

## 9. Dock, sell, upgrade

*(See [dock-and-economy.md](features/dock-and-economy.md).)*

1. With cargo in your hold, fly into Earth's, Mars's, or Venus's port zone.
2. Confirm the **Dock** toolbar button becomes enabled, and click it.
3. Confirm the dock card shows "Docked at *body*", a Sell button priced at your cargo's total
   value, and a Refill button.
4. Click **Sell cargo**. Confirm credits increase and cargo drops to 0.
5. Click **Refill mass**. Confirm mass pulses return to capacity.
6. In the Upgrades table, buy a **Reaction mass** upgrade (if you have 2000+ credits). Confirm
   the level increments, the displayed capacity increases by 150, and the next price roughly
   doubles.

**Broken looks like:** Dock button never enabling inside the zone, sell not paying out, or an
upgrade button staying enabled/disabled incorrectly relative to your credits.

---

## 10. Deck walk, rum wobble, first person

*(See [deck-view.md](features/deck-view.md).)*

1. Click **Deck**. Confirm a top-down interior view loads with your avatar near the bridge.
2. Walk with `WASD` toward the **CANTINA**. Confirm collision stops you at walls rather than
   clipping through.
3. Press `E` at the cantina three times, each within a few seconds of the last.
4. Confirm the third interaction shows "That was the third tot. The deck feels… tilty." and your
   movement direction visibly wobbles for about 25 seconds.
5. Confirm you can still walk and interact normally during the wobble (it's cosmetic, not a
   lockout).
6. Press `F`. Confirm the view switches to first-person, with a real sky visible through the
   windows (sun and planets at their correct positions/sizes).
7. Press `Q`. Confirm you're returned to the helm view (map/plot), not just the deck plan.

**Broken looks like:** no wobble after 3 rapid tots, wobble blocking interaction entirely, or `F`
not producing a real (ephemeris-matched) sky.

---

## 11. Boarding run minigame

*(See [boarding-run.md](features/boarding-run.md).)*

1. Get a capture window open against a selected target (see script 5 or 8).
2. Click **Deck**, walk to the **SHUTTLE BAY**, press `E`.
3. Confirm you're now flying a shuttle with `WASD` thrust toward a visible target airlock.
4. Fly in too fast on purpose. Confirm you **bounce** off (velocity reverses/halves) rather than
   docking, and the run continues.
5. Slow down and dock properly. Confirm it reports a soft dock and boarding completes instantly
   (no waiting out the timer).
6. Repeat, but this time press `Q` mid-run. Confirm the run aborts and the shuttle returns to the
   cradle without boarding.
7. Repeat once more, and deliberately let your mothership drift out of the capture window mid-run.
   Confirm the shuttle auto-returns and the run ends as a loss.

**Broken looks like:** no bounce on a hot approach, docking not completing the boarding, or the
shuttle not returning when the window closes.

---

## 12. Electric scenario venting

*(See [electric-sky.md](features/electric-sky.md).)*

1. Launch **Sol (Electric)**. Confirm the HUD shows a Charge bar under the main readouts.
2. Warp toward the sun (or into a visible plasma stream). Confirm the charge percentage climbs.
3. Let it reach 90%+. Confirm the HUD flags "⚡ ARCING — visible system-wide" and a halo ring
   appears around your ship on the map.
4. Press `V`. Confirm charge drops to roughly half its prior value and the arcing warning clears
   once under 90%.
5. Press `V` again immediately. Confirm a "Vent recharging…" message appears (cooldown) rather
   than a second instant halving.
6. Fly into a plasma stream while charged and confirm you feel a push along the stream's
   direction (speed changes without spending a pulse).

**Broken looks like:** charge never climbing near the sun, arcing warning never appearing, or
venting not reducing the charge value.

---

## 13. Tracking post scan-to-track

*(See [tracking-post.md](features/tracking-post.md).)*

1. Launch Sol. Click **Track 📡**. Confirm the card opens with a sun-relative rosette, bearing/arc
   sliders, and a program dropdown.
2. Pick a corridor program from the dropdown (e.g. "Earth–Mars corridor watch"). Confirm the
   bearing/arc sliders jump to match it and the wedge on the rosette redraws.
3. Click **Start sweep**. Confirm a progress bar appears and "Sweeping…" shows underneath.
4. Warp forward until the sweep completes (a full 360° takes 6 sim-hours; a narrow wedge is
   faster). Confirm a message like "Sweep complete — N contact(s) found" (or "nothing found").
5. If something was found, confirm it appears in the **Tracked targets** table with a quality bar
   and days-since-confirm.
6. Click **Confirm** on a tracked entry. Confirm the message reports either a reconfirm (quality
   bar rises) or "Lost the fix… try a fresh sweep".
7. Return to the map and confirm the tracked ship draws with a brighter marker and a thin ring
   around it (versus an untracked ship's plain dot).

**Broken looks like:** the sweep never completing, the ledger never gaining an entry despite a
plausible sweep, or the tracked ring never appearing on the map.

---

## 14. Local space trade

*(See [local-space.md](features/local-space.md).)*

1. Launch Sol with cargo in your hold (board a depot first if empty — see script 8). Orbit-assist
   into a planet with a depot (e.g. Mars).
2. Confirm the **Local space** panel opens on its own the moment you're bound in orbit, listing at
   least the planet's depot with a 🛰 icon and a **Trade** badge/button.
3. Click **Trade** on the depot row. Confirm a striped progress bar appears reading "Drones
   ferrying — NN%".
4. Let it run in real time (don't just warp — the transfer accrues on the wall clock). Confirm it
   completes and your cargo hold empties into credits, matching dock-and-economy sell prices.
5. Pulse away from orbit mid-transfer on a fresh attempt. Confirm the progress bar resets/vanishes
   and no credit is paid — the envelope broke and progress was lost, no partial credit.
6. Toggle the panel closed and back open with the **Local 🛰** button; confirm it still shows the
   same contact list.

**Broken looks like:** the panel never auto-opening on entering orbit, the Trade button staying
enabled with an empty hold, or credits being paid out despite the transfer being interrupted.

---

## 15. Dark web intel buy/sell + laser ranging

*(See [dark-web.md](features/dark-web.md).)*

1. Launch Sol. Fly to (or orbit) a haven — e.g. Ringside Exchange or Enceladus — or a far station
   beyond ~4×10¹¹ m from the sun.
2. Click **Web 🕸**. Confirm the dark-web section shows a table of off-the-books ships instead of
   the "not orbiting or docked at a haven…" message.
3. Buy a route tip on a listed ship. Confirm credits drop by the shown price and the button now
   reads "Known".
4. Open **Traffic** and confirm the bought ship now appears in the table with a `🕸 stale in Nd`
   badge next to its callsign.
5. Back in **Web 🕸**, use the **Track 📡** panel first to get at least one tracked contact at
   ≥50% quality, then confirm it appears under "Your sellable tracks" with a **Sell** button; click
   it and confirm credits increase.
6. Pick a tracked contact in the tight-beam dropdown and click **Hail**. Confirm an inline reply
   appears (a destination for a publishing ship, "No flight plan filed" for a secretive one).
7. Click **Laser range** on a tracked contact. Confirm a "lit up ⚠" message appears, and back in
   the **Track 📡** panel that ship's ledger row now shows an `aware ⚠` tag.

**Broken looks like:** the dark-web section trading from an ordinary planet/dock, a bought tip
never appearing on the traffic board, or laser ranging not marking the target aware.

---

## 16. War room warning-shot / bribe / heat loop

*(See [war-room.md](features/war-room.md).)*

1. Launch Sol. Intercept a freighter (not a pod) close enough to be inside weapon range (2×10⁸ m —
   tighter than the boarding capture envelope). Click **Guns ⚔**.
2. Confirm the tactical circle shows your ship, a weapon-range ring, and the target as a dot with a
   status badge (🏳 compliant or ⚔ stubborn).
3. Click **Hail**. Confirm an inline threat/reply line appears matching the status badge (surrender
   line if compliant, defiance line if stubborn).
4. Click **Warn**. Confirm the button is only enabled while inside weapon range; if the target's
   compliant, board it and confirm boarding completes in roughly half the usual time.
5. On a different ship, click **Bribe** instead. Confirm credits drop by the shown price, the badge
   changes to **🤝 bribed**, and the button disables itself afterward.
6. Board and rob a (non-bribed) compliant or stubborn ship. Confirm the heat gauge in the header
   ticks up at least one flame (`◌◌◌` → `🔥◌◌`) and the cooling line shows a decay rate.
7. Warp forward several sim-days. Confirm heat decays by one level roughly on schedule (20 days per
   level, or 4× faster if you dock/orbit at a haven the whole time).
8. After a heat-raising robbery, confirm a hunter eventually appears (bearing/distance line in the
   header, red 🐺 marker on the map) and that hiding in continuous haven orbit for a couple of
   sim-days makes it break off.

**Broken looks like:** Warn/Bribe enabled outside their stated ranges/conditions, heat never rising
after a robbery, or a hunter never spawning or never breaking off at a haven.
