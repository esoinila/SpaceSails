    // clandestine operation was hiding from its own staff.

    //
    //   * depth is free — a floor reuses the surface's own envelope, so a hidden band takes no space;
    //   * bands already gate descent, and a hidden band is that mechanism with the next shaft simply not
    //     advertised;
    //   * Kind already varies the building, so the deepest band can be a DIFFERENT KIND from the floors
    //     above it — a records annex whose bottom is a clinic tells a story nobody has to narrate.
    //
    // THE BUILDING LIES BY OMISSION, which is exactly in register with everything else down here. The panel
    // on the floor above says what it has always said: there is no button below this one. It does not hedge,
    // it does not hint, and it is not lying about a door — the button really is not there. The way down is a
